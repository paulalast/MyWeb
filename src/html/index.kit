                    Hi there! Iâ€™m Paulina - a junior <strong>Web
                        Developer</strong> with a
                    front-end development focus. Iâ€™m passionate about building
                    stunning, useful websites that are tailored to each clientâ€™s
                    specific requirements. I bring a keen eye for detail and
                    design to every project I work on because of my background
                    in photography.
                    In addition to my expertise in web development, my
                    experience in social media and advertising has taught me the
                    value of active listening and a focus on the goals of the
                    customer. I recognise that every company is different, and I
                    work hard to develop a customised solution for each of my
                    clients.
                    <br> <br>
                    I am committed to producing top-notch work and going above
                    and beyond for clients. I design user-friendly, scalable,
                    mobile-first websites that are designed for success in the
                    rapidly changing digital market. Iâ€™m happy to work with you
                    to advance your internet presence, whether you run a small
                    business or a huge organisation.
                    <br><br>
                    Together, letâ€™s design a website that will not only be eye
                    catching but also useful and successful in supporting you in
                    reaching your goals.
